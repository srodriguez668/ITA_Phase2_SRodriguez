// In the process of looking for a good regex I came across this one. I was creating
// a forEach loop which this code does a much better job at. As they say, don't try to reinvent the wheel.
// I did learn that .some is same thing as .test with regex but a test for an array (super useful)
// Also big brain move to use lastIndexOf to make sure something is not repeating. All this to say while I 
// did not code most of it I spent a good 30-40 mins googling and learning from this one

//ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters 
//after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

//Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without 
//reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next 
//[1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
